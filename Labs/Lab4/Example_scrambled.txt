This "Cambridge Effect" is sort of true, but it does not tell the whole story.It is relatively easy to read short words, but not so easy when reading longerwords. Alas, most content words in English are seven letters long or longer --the more letters there are in a word, the more difficult and complicated itbecomes to correctly identify them when the letters are rearranged. Whereas,more diminutive and common words like "ball" and "bear" remain mostly unchangedand easy to recognize, longer, less common words, like "pollution" and"simultaneous" change substantially to the point where recognition is scarcelypossible. Furthermore, this ability stems from a great deal of experiencereading correctly spelled words -- only people who can already read proficientlycan do this task. This trick does not reveal much about the process of learningto read -- it only indicates that highly skilled readers are so practiced withtext they can overcome minor imperfections (emphasis on the word "minor") inthe print to access meaning.Oh, and by the way, there never was any published research of this sortconducted at Cambridge University. That part is completely untrue.
